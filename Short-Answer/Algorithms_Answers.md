#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - This would almost appear to be O(n^3) however, the extra n's are canceled by a = a + n * n which rapidly decreases the amount it take for a to be greater than or equal to n

b) O(nlogn) - Since the second loop is not growing by 1 but rather doubles, as n grows, the second loop takes less time to complete. The first loop take n times to complete thus giving n * log(n)

c) O(n) - The function is recursively called the number of bunnies there are since bunnies-1 is called until the base case is reached where bunnies == 0
